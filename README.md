# Mari0 FE - Frustrated with a feature's absence? Add it.

git.io/fA7Af


Initial Commit:

region triggers can now detect a specific enemy category - just type a number into the input box. "true" and "false" emulate the vanilla behaviour of enemy detection. this may break other usages of "checkrect".

added givesacoin, givesdecacoin, and givestime for custom enemies. these override givesalife.

also added givestimeamount.

changed folder to mari0_fe so that things don't crash in unmodded SE.


smb Mappack will no longer disappear if you load anything else.

kooparedflying is fixed - shoutouts to Alesan for this.

scaffolds are no longer invisible in the editor.


deleted the map previews of /smb/ so it fit.
---------------

Commit 2:

Changed Files: game

merged givesdecacoin into givesacoin, and added givescoinamount for consistency and flexibility
